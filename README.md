# Third-World-Healthcare-System
Senior Design project to find a solution to improve the healthcare systems in underdeveloped countries.

At the moment, it is a Node.js web application with an Angular front-end.

In this base directory, run "./build.sh -p {password}" to run the server, set up the test db, and open a web page.
This build script will do an npm install on everything in ./web/node/required-npm-packages . If you want to skip this process, add an -s flag. i.e.
"./build.sh -p {password} -s"
